# Javascript Geometry Engine and Graphics framework
A geometry engine and graphics framework that abstracts away from canvas2D and WebGL and is able to handle either one transparent to the programmer
* The following example game implements this framework on Canvas2D -> [Example1](http://www.rayflectar.com/p03-Concepts/p03-MathMoth/game.html) 
* The following example game implements this framework on Canvas WebGL -> [Example2](http://www.rayflectar.com/p04-Programming/p01-Rubik/rubik.html)

The JS files behind both example games are left intentionally readable (via Chrome-->DeveloperTools)

* A brief explanation outlining the deisgn concept is shown --> [here](https://github.com/ThomasAn73/Javascript-Graphics-Framework/blob/master/CONCEPTUAL%20OUTLINE%20of%20this%20Framework.pdf) 
* A preliminary ToDO list can be seen --> [here](https://github.com/ThomasAn73/Javascript-Graphics-Framework/blob/master/TO%20DO%20list) 
* An example "HelloWorld" project can be seen --> [here](https://github.com/ThomasAn73/Javascript-Graphics-Framework/blob/master/EXAMPLE.zip)
Extract the ZIP file into a folder, drop the JS files and the two glsl shader files into the same folder and run the Example.html
